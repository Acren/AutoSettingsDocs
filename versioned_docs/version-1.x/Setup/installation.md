# Installation

**Auto Settings** is available as a plugin through the [Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/auto-settings-game-options-and-input-binding-toolkit).

Installation is typical for an Unreal plugin:

1. Install through the Epic Games Launcher
2. Enable the plugin in the `Edit > Plugins` menu in your project

At this point the plugin should be enabled in your project and ready for you to use.

If you want to use the menu or assets from the example project, [read how to migrate them here](/info/example-project).

Or, you can move on to using the [UMG Widgets](/setup/umg-widgets) to add [settings](/setup/settings) and [input bindings](/setup/input-binding) to your own menu.
